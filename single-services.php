                                                <li><strong>Ease of Registration:</strong> Registering a proprietorship
                                                    does not require formal incorporation or dissolution processes.
                                                    However, obtaining necessary licenses and registrations such as GST
                                                    and UDYAM ensures compliance.</li>

                                                    interact with tax departments like GST or Income Tax, reducing
                                                    compliance burdens compared to LLPs or companies.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Simple Decision-Making:</strong> With no partners or
                                                    directors, the proprietor has full authority to make quick and
                                                    independent business decisions.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Complete Control:</strong> As the sole owner, the proprietor
                                                    retains full control over the business.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Better Tax Benefits:</strong> The income generated by the
                                                    firm directly passes through a single layer of income tax. In some
                                                    cases, it is also eligible for up to a 20% tax deduction.</li>

                                            <li><strong>Ease of Registration:</strong> Registering a proprietorship does
                                                not require formal incorporation or dissolution processes. However,
                                                obtaining necessary licenses and registrations such as GST and UDYAM
                                                ensures compliance.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Low Compliance:</strong> Sole proprietorships primarily interact
                                                with tax departments like GST or Income Tax, reducing compliance burdens
                                                compared to LLPs or companies.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Simple Decision-Making:</strong> With no partners or directors,
                                                the proprietor has full authority to make quick and independent business
                                                decisions.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Complete Control:</strong> As the sole owner, the proprietor
                                                retains full control over the business.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Better Tax Benefits:</strong> The income generated by the firm
                                                directly passes through a single layer of income tax. In some cases, it
                                                is also eligible for up to a 20% tax deduction.</li>

                                    and controlled by a single individual. It is the simplest and oldest form of
                                    business entity in India, where the proprietor and the business are treated as one
                                    entity.</p>

                                <p>There are no distinct types of proprietorships as it is inherently a single-owner
                                    business model. However, proprietorships can operate in various industries such as

                                    liable for all business activities. A firm, on the other hand, usually implies a
                                    partnership where two or more individuals share ownership, responsibilities, and
                                    profits.</p>
